# GPU Detection System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented robust GPU detection and environment adaptation system to resolve EGL initialization issues and improve compatibility across different runtime environments.

## Key Components

### 1. GPUDetector Class (`gpu_detector.h/cpp`)
- **Environment Detection**: Automatically detects Flatpak, Docker, or Native environments
- **GPU Backend Detection**: Identifies NVIDIA EGL, Mesa EGL, or CPU-only modes
- **Library Path Management**: Dynamically configures optimal EGL library paths
- **Capability Assessment**: Reports available GPU features and vendor information

### 2. Smart Graph Selection
- **Dynamic Graph Choice**: Automatically selects GPU or CPU graph based on capabilities
- **Graceful Fallback**: Uses CPU-only processing when GPU unavailable
- **Stream Adaptation**: Handles different output stream names between GPU/CPU graphs

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- **Predictive Detection**: Tests GPU capabilities before MediaPipe initialization
- **Clear Feedback**: Provides detailed status messages for troubleshooting
- **Environment Awareness**: Adapts behavior based on runtime environment

### Key Achievements
1. **Eliminated EGL_BAD_DISPLAY errors** through proper environment detection
2. **Automatic library path configuration** for different environments
3. **Robust fallback mechanisms** when GPU unavailable
4. **Better user experience** with clear status messages and automatic adaptation

## Integration Points
